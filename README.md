# Data_Science_Portfolio
Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! This repository showcases a variety of projects where I apply data science techniques to solve real-world problems. Here, you'll find projects ranging from exploratory data analysis to complex machine learning models. Each project is documented with detailed Jupyter notebooks, providing insights into my analytical approach and coding skills.

Key Features:

Diverse Projects: Includes Medical Insurance analysis, Linear Regression, predictive modelling, etc Real-World Datasets: Utilizes datasets from various domains like healthcare, insurance, finance etc. Technological Stack: Demonstrates proficiency in Python and its data science libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, etc.), along with SQL, and data visualization tools. Innovative Solutions: Focus on aspects like AI, big data analytics, machine learning algorithms. Clear Documentation: Each project comes with a thorough explanation, making the repository a valuable resource for anyone interested in data science.

Whether you're a fellow data scientist, a recruiter, or just a data enthusiast, I hope you find these projects both informative and inspiring. Feel free to explore, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or feedback!
